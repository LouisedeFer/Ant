# Langton's Ant

The Langton’s Ant is an automata made of an ant that walks on a square grid while coloring each tile according to the following process:

If the ant is on a white tile, it turns 90° on the right, otherwise it turns 90° on the left.
The ant inverts the coloring of a tile before leaving it. A white tile becomes a red one, and a black tile becomes a white one.
The ant move forward to an adjacent tile.
This process is repeated at each step.


The user can move in the created board with the keyboard arrows.



The initial conditions are:
The ant is oriented toward the TOP.
The current tile is white.

Other conditions:
There is no limit of the square grid.
The “world” is white, meaning that any new tile is always white.
